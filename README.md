## Notes

### Structure

The application is structured as follows:

- src
  - app
    - components
    - hooks
    - interfaces
    - views
  - config

#### Components

Here are the basic building blocks along with some more complex shared components.

### Hooks

This is where... well - the hooks are.

### Interfaces

And this is where I put shared interfaces.

### Views

Each view integrates the components to create value. There are currently only two views, `ShowsView` and `ShowView`.

### Config

A configuration file that right now only contains very little information. Can be accessed in runtime.
